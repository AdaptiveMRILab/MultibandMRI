	abstract = {We introduce MRpro, an open-source image reconstruction package built upon PyTorch and open data formats. The framework comprises three main areas. First, it provides unified data structures for the consistent manipulation of MR datasets and their associated metadata (e.g., k-space trajectories). Second, it offers a library of composable operators, proximable functionals, and optimization algorithms, including a unified Fourier operator for all common trajectories and an extended phase graph simulation for quantitative MR. These components are used to create ready-to-use implementations of key reconstruction algorithms. Third, for deep learning, MRpro includes essential building blocks such as data consistency layers, differentiable optimization layers, and state-of-the-art backbone networks and integrates public datasets to facilitate reproducibility. MRpro is developed as a collaborative project supported by automated quality control. We demonstrate the versatility of MRpro across multiple applications, including Cartesian, radial, and spiral acquisitions; motion-corrected reconstruction; cardiac MR fingerprinting; learned spatially adaptive regularization weights; model-based learned image reconstruction and quantitative parameter estimation. MRpro offers an extensible framework for MR image reconstruction. With reproducibility and maintainability at its core, it facilitates collaborative development and provides a foundation for future MR imaging research.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a powerful technique for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. However, SMS reconstruction remains challenging due to complex signal interactions between and within the excited slices. In this study, we introduce ROGER, a robust SMS MRI reconstruction method based on deep generative priors. Utilizing denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), ROGER begins with Gaussian noise and gradually recovers individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while enforcing data consistency from measured k-space data within the readout concatenation framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM training can be performed on single-slice images without requiring modifications for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method incorporates a low-frequency enhancement (LFE) module to address the practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo (FSE) and echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed fully-sampled autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments on both retrospectively and prospectively accelerated datasets demonstrate that ROGER consistently outperforms existing methods, enhancing both anatomical and functional imaging with strong out-of-distribution generalization. The source code and sample data for ROGER are available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/ROGER.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous multislice Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) acquisition using parallel imaging can decrease the acquisition time for diffusion imaging and allow full-brain, high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI) acquisitions at a reduced repetition time (TR). However, the unaliasing of simultaneously acquired, closely spaced slices can be difficult, leading to a high g-factor penalty. We introduce a method to create interslice image shifts in the phase encoding direction to increase the distance between aliasing pixels. The shift between the slices is induced using sign- and amplitude-modulated slice-select gradient blips simultaneous with the EPI phase encoding blips. This achieves the desired shifts but avoids an undesired “tilted voxel” blurring artifact associated with previous methods. We validate the method in 3× slice-accelerated spin-echo and gradient-echo EPI at 3 T and 7 T using 32-channel radio frequency (RF) coil brain arrays. The Monte-Carlo simulated average g-factor penalty of the 3-fold slice-accelerated acquisition with interslice shifts is {\textless}1\% at 3 T (compared with 32\% without slice shift). Combining 3× slice acceleration with 2× inplane acceleration, the g-factor penalty becomes 19\% at 3 T and 10\% at 7 T (compared with 41\% and 23\% without slice shift). We demonstrate the potential of the method for accelerating diffusion imaging by comparing the fiber orientation uncertainty, where the 3-fold faster acquisition showed no noticeable degradation.

	abstract = {Purpose Controlled aliasing techniques for simultaneously acquired echo-planar imaging slices have been shown to significantly increase the temporal efficiency for both diffusion-weighted imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. The “slice-GRAPPA” (SG) method has been widely used to reconstruct such data. We investigate robust optimization techniques for SG to ensure image reconstruction accuracy through a reduction of leakage artifacts. Methods Split SG is proposed as an alternative kernel optimization method. The performance of Split SG is compared to standard SG using data collected on a spherical phantom and in vivo on two subjects at 3 T. Slice-accelerated and nonaccelerated data were collected for a spin-echo diffusion-weighted acquisition. Signal leakage metrics and time-series SNR were used to quantify the performance of the kernel fitting approaches. Results The Split SG optimization strategy significantly reduces leakage artifacts for both phantom and in vivo acquisitions. In addition, a significant boost in time-series SNR for in vivo diffusion-weighted acquisitions with in-plane and slice accelerations was observed with the Split SG approach. Conclusion By minimizing the influence of leakage artifacts during the training of SG kernels, we have significantly improved reconstruction accuracy. Our robust kernel fitting strategy should enable better reconstruction accuracy and higher slice-acceleration across many applications.

	abstract = {Purpose Ghosting-robust reconstruction of blipped-CAIPI echo planar imaging simultaneous multislice data with low computational load. Methods To date, Slice-GRAPPA, with “odd–even” kernels that improve ghosting performance, has been the framework of choice for such reconstructions due to its predecessor SENSE-GRAPPA being deemed unsuitable for blipped-CAIPI data. Modifications to SENSE-GRAPPA are used to restore CAIPI compatibility and to make it robust against ghosting. Two implementations are tested, one where slices and in-plane unaliasing are dealt in the same serial manner as in Slice-GRAPPA [referred to as one-dimensional (1D)-NGC-SENSE-GRAPPA, where NGC stands for Nyquist Ghost Corrected] and one where both are unaliased in a single step (2D-NGC-SENSE-GRAPPA), which is analytically and experimentally shown to be computationally cheaper. Results The 1D-NGC-SENSE-GRAPPA and odd-even Slice-GRAPPA perform identically, whereas 2D-NGC-SENSE-GRAPPA shows reduced error propagation, less residual ghosting when reliable reference data were available. When the latter was not the case, error propagation was increased. Conclusion Unlike Slice-GRAPPA, SENSE-GRAPPA operates fully within the GRAPPA framework, for which improved reconstructions (e.g., iterative, nonlinear) have been developed over the past decade. It could, therefore, bring benefit to the reconstruction of SMS data as an attractive alternative to Slice-GRAPPA.

Theory Robust artificial-neural-networks for k-space interpolation (RAKI) reconstruction trains convolutional neural networks on ACS data. This enables nonlinear estimation of missing k-space lines from acquired k-space data with improved noise resilience, as opposed to conventional linear k-space interpolation-based methods, such as GRAPPA, which are based on linear convolutional kernels. Methods The training algorithm is implemented using a mean square error loss function over the target points in the ACS region, using a gradient descent algorithm. The neural network contains 3 layers of convolutional operators, with 2 of these including nonlinear activation functions. The noise performance and reconstruction quality of the RAKI method was compared with GRAPPA in phantom, as well as in neurological and cardiac in vivo data sets. Results Phantom imaging shows that the proposed RAKI method outperforms GRAPPA at high (≥4) acceleration rates, both visually and quantitatively. Quantitative cardiac imaging shows improved noise resilience at high acceleration rates (rate 4:23\% and rate 5:48\%) over GRAPPA. The same trend of improved noise resilience is also observed in high-resolution brain imaging at high acceleration rates. Conclusion The RAKI method offers a training database-free deep learning approach for MRI reconstruction, with the potential to improve many existing reconstruction approaches, and is compatible with conventional data acquisition protocols.},

	abstract = {Parallel imaging is the most clinically used acceleration technique for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in part due to its easy inclusion into routine acquisitions. In k-space based parallel imaging reconstruction, sub-sampled k-space data are interpolated using linear convolutions. At high acceleration rates these methods have inherent noise amplification and reduced image quality. On the other hand, non-linear deep learning methods provide improved image quality at high acceleration, but the availability of training databases for different scans, as well as their interpretability hinder their adaptation. In this work, we present an extension of Robust Artificial-neural-networks for k-space Interpolation (RAKI), called residual-RAKI (rRAKI), which achieves scan-specific machine learning reconstruction using a hybrid linear and non-linear methodology. In rRAKI, non-linear CNNs are trained jointly with a linear convolution implemented via a skip connection. In effect, the linear part provides a baseline reconstruction, while the non-linear CNN that runs in parallel provides further reduction of artifacts and noise arising from the linear part. The explicit split between the linear and non-linear aspects of the reconstruction also help improve interpretability compared to purely non-linear methods. Experiments were conducted on the publicly available fastMRI datasets, as well as high-resolution anatomical imaging, comparing GRAPPA and its variants, compressed sensing, RAKI, Scan Specific Artifact Reduction in K-space (SPARK) and the proposed rRAKI. Additionally, highly-accelerated simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) functional MRI reconstructions were also performed, where the proposed rRAKI was compred to Read-out SENSE-GRAPPA and RAKI. Our results show that the proposed rRAKI method substantially improves the image quality compared to conventional parallel imaging, and offers sharper images compared to SPARK and ℓ1-SPIRiT. Furthermore, rRAKI shows improved preservation of time-varying dynamics compared to both parallel imaging and RAKI in highly-accelerated SMS fMRI.},

	abstract = {Several deep-learning models have been proposed to shorten MRI scan time. Prior deep-learning models that utilize real-valued kernels have limited capability to learn rich representations of complex MRI data. In this work, we utilize a complex-valued convolutional network (ℂNet) for fast reconstruction of highly under-sampled MRI data and evaluate its ability to rapidly reconstruct 3D late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) data. ℂNet preserves the complex nature and optimal combination of real and imaginary components of MRI data throughout the reconstruction process by utilizing complex-valued convolution, novel radial batch normalization, and complex activation function layers in a U-Net architecture. A prospectively under-sampled 3D LGE cardiac MRI dataset of 219 patients (17 003 images) at acceleration rates R = 3 through R = 5 was used to evaluate ℂNet. The dataset was further retrospectively under-sampled to a maximum of R = 8 to simulate higher acceleration rates. We created three reconstructions of the 3D LGE dataset using (1) ℂNet, (2) a compressed-sensing-based low-dimensional-structure self-learning and thresholding algorithm (LOST), and (3) a real-valued U-Net (realNet) with the same number of parameters as ℂNet. LOST-reconstructed data were considered the reference for training and evaluation of all models. The reconstructed images were quantitatively evaluated using mean-squared error (MSE) and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and subjectively evaluated by three independent readers. Quantitatively, ℂNet-reconstructed images had significantly improved MSE and SSIM values compared with realNet (MSE, 0.077 versus 0.091; SSIM, 0.876 versus 0.733, respectively; p {\textless} 0.01). Subjective quality assessment showed that ℂNet-reconstructed image quality was similar to that of compressed sensing and significantly better than that of realNet. ℂNet reconstruction was also more than 300 times faster than compressed sensing. Retrospective under-sampled images demonstrate the potential of ℂNet at higher acceleration rates. ℂNet enables fast reconstruction of highly accelerated 3D MRI with superior performance to real-valued networks, and achieves faster reconstruction than compressed sensing.},

This technique efficiently reduces the size of parallel imaging data acquired from a multichannel coil array, thereby significantly reducing the reconstruction time and computer memory requirement without undermining the benefits of multichannel coil arrays. Clinical data collected with a 32-channel cardiac coil are used in all of the experiments. The performance of the proposed method on parallel, partially acquired data, as well as fully acquired data, was evaluated. Experimental results show that the proposed method dramatically reduces the processing time without considerable degradation in the quality of reconstructed images.
